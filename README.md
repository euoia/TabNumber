# TabNumber

A plugin for Google Chrome that adds numbers to your tabs.

This makes it easier to switch to a specific tab with command + number.

Only tabs 4 to 9 get a number since tabs 1 to 3 are easy to see and tabs
greater than 9 cannot be reached with a keyboard shortcut.

## Installation

In Chrome's preferences, go to Extensions and check Developer mode. Then Click
_Load unpacked extension..._. Select the `1_0` directory and click _Select_.

Newly created tabs will show a number before the tab title.
